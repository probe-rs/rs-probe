# The Rusty Probe

This is an open hardware probe for the Serial Wire Debug (SWD) and JTAG protocol.
Based on the RP2040 MCU.

## Firmware

The firmware is available [here](https://github.com/probe-rs/rusty-probe-firmware) and is open-source.

## Features

- The 10-pin Cortex-Debug connector is used.
- The programming connector is the Tag Connect TC2030, however for just loading firmware the USB bootloader is recommended.
- Castellated vias for all programming pins, power and 2 GPIOs.
- USB-C connector.
- Target 5V and `Vtarget` is protected with an diode circuit to not have current flow from the target to the host.
- The probe support 1.8v - 3.3v signal voltage and can track `Vtarget`.
- The key pin on the Cortex-Debug can be connected to the protected 5V.

The schematic can be found in the GitHub actions, full production files are generated for each commit.
